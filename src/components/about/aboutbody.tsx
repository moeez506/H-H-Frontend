          As an Organization we do understand our community needs assistance
          .Death comes unannounced and neither is anyone prepared when death
          knocks. This is the more reason why we have to be prepared at all
          times .Planning for such unforeseen circumstances is giving your
          family peace of mind to give you the last respect needed. The best
          gift we can give our love ones is to give them the opportunity to be
          able to celebrate us on earth and when we leave this world .In
          developed countries this is done through life insurance .We do
          understand everyone would like to have a life insurance but such
          privileges are not available for everyone. Death comes with so much
          pain ,stress to family members. We do understand health care is very
          expensive with expenditure before and after in puts the bereaved
          family in a difficult position. This is where H&H comes in ,We should
          not be mourning our loves ones and be financially stressed .With H&H
          community Crowd Funding System each association (members) will be able
          to contributions upon the death announcement of any of its members
          aimed at lessening the burden on the family of deceased members by
          assisting with funeral cost, arrangements, and repatriation to a final
          resting place. Members will only contribute when there is a death
          occurrence . H&H has a harmonious and organized approach based on the
          strength of numbers. We believe that each death is a death to the
          community and as such we call on each member to act with compassion
          and commitment.<br></br>The more the members and association the less
          amount each member will contribute when a death occurs. We take any
          death in our community seriously.<br></br>H&H upon any death
          occurrence ,will announce to all members association and contributions
          have to be done within 72 hours .The amount would be disburse to the
          deceased next of kin

          our communities . H&H and its international partners are dedicated in
          helping during such times . We have therefore ,put in place a
          mechanism to assist all H&H members financially when diagnosed with a
          terminal disease or when found in a critical health circumstance. This
          assistance will be available only for active members and conditions
